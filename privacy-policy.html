In addition, First for Cloud will not sell your personal information to third parties unless you give us your specific permission to do so.

In addition, First for Cloud may be obligated to disclose personal information to meet any legal or regulatory requirements of applicable laws. First for Cloud and/or the Reseller may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you an email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

  <p>First for Cloud and/or the Reseller may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.</p>
